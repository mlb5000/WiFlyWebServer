VERY early implementation of a single-connection Web Server hosted through a Roving Networks WiFly Module.

Set ACCESS_POINT and PASSPHRASE in WebServerDemo.pde to get the WiFly to connect to your router.

Environment requires:
  * ArduPilot-Mega make build environment
  * drop this directory into the ArduPilot-Mega/libraries directory and run 'make'.
